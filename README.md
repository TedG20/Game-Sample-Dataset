# Game Length Analysis

## Overview
This project explores a small dataset containing game number and game length values. The goal was to clean the data by removing noisy entries and then visualize the cleaned results.

## What I Tried
1. Loaded the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Filtered out noisy entries by:
   - Removing missing values
   - Removing duplicate records
   - Excluding unrealistic or outlier game lengths
3. Generated a **bar graph** to visualize game length across game numbers using the cleaned data.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
- Cleaned dataset
- Bar graph showing game length per game number
